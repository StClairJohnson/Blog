        <h2>General Interests</h2>
        <p>
           When I was young, I had a lot of free time. So just I engaged in a lot 
           of videogames and cartoons to pass the time. I always thought that
            watching the characters in a TV show goof off and get into wacky 
            shenanigans was really fun, and playing as my favorite character 
            in a party game was even better! But when it comes to media like this,
            everyone has their favorites. That's why I'll be discussing my favorite
         cartoons and videogames!.
        </p>
        <h2>My Favorite Cartoon</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>

        <p>
           My favorite cartoon is The Amazing World Of Gumball! This show takes place in 
           the perfectly average city of Elmore. It may seem average on the outside, but in 
           my opinion, the town of Elmore is filled with wacky, shady, and obnoxious characters 
           that attempt to live out their daily lives as best as they can, but can never seem 
           to catch a break. This show follows the Watterson Family, but primarily the eldest 
           son of the family, Gumball Watterson, and his fish friend named Darwin, who is more of 
           a brother to him than anything else. They always seem to be an omen for disaster. And 
           because of that, they always find themselves on a wacky adventure. Whether the want to 
           or not.

        <h3>Why I like it</h3>

            I personally love The Amazing World Of Gumball because it is so wacky and random, 
            that I never get bored. The sense of humor in this show is hilarous and everyone 
            in this show is an absolute savage! Gumball's sracastic, nonshalant attitude and 
            his clever comebacks and off-handed remarks never fail to get a chuckle out of me. 
            It was definitely a change of pace from other shows that were out at the time 
            because The Amazing World Of Gumball didn't attempt to teach its audience valuable 
            lessons each episode like the other show. It just wanted to have fun and that's what 
            I appreciate about it. This show has a tendency to get really sad and depressing when 
            it wants to and it always makes tugs at my heartstrings.

        <h2>My Favorite Videogame</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>

           My favorite videogame that I have played is the Danganronpa Series. Danganronpa 
           is a murder mystery visual novel that is available for PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, 
           and PC. This game follows 16 high school students as they are trapped in aschool and 
           forced to murder each other to leave. Each student has been enrolled at Hope's Peak 
           Academy for being the best at what they are interested in, earning themselves the 
           title of "Ultimate". These Ultimate Students can vary from the Ultimate Programmer 
           to the Ultimate Biker Gang Leader. Everytime a student dies, the rest of the students 
           have to investigate the murder, and  participate in a Class Trial to find the student who 
           committed the crime. If they guess correctly, than they get to live and the student 
           that committed murder dies in an execution. If they don't, then everyone else besides 
           the culprit dies and the culprit gets to leave the school. This is what Monokuma, 
           the game's host, calls the "killing game".

           <h3>Why I like It</h3>

            I personally enjoy Danganronpa because I find solving mysteries really fun. As 
            the games progress, the murders get more and more complicated, which can lead to 
            plot twist after plot twist which can make for a pretty fun experience. Of course 
            this game is pretty brutal with all of the blood and gore, but when has that ever 
            stopped anyone. The game allows you to get close to the students with Free Time Events 
            and the game is several hours long, so when the characters meet their end, it's even 
            more depressing since it felt like you had a connection to them. he real gameplay 
            aspect of the game comes from the class trials. In said class trials, you use the 
            evidence you've gathered in your investigation to refute claims and prove testimonies 
            in a variety of minigames that test both your knowledge of the case and reaction time. 
            I would find the game slightly boring if you just listened to everyone figure the case 
            out fr you, so It adds a layer of engagement the I really appreciate. Once you do find 
            the culprit, They get a special execution tailored to their Ultimate talent or 
            something they valued or dislkied in life that'll have you thinking how that is an 
            awful way to go.

           <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                It was very hard to choose my favorite cartoon and videogame out of the numerous 
                games that I have played and watched. I tried to take my nostalgia glasses off 
                and look at these games from a retrospective point of view, Moreso for The Amazing 
                World Of Gumball than Danganronpa. There are other shows that made my childhood 
                like Steven Universe, SpongeBob SquarePants, Regular Show, FanBoy and Chum Chum, 
                Star Vs. the Forces of Evil amd more. As you can see I was primarily a Cartoon 
                Network child. I wanted to pick a show from my childhood because I felt like 
                there was a sense of childlike wonder when watching these cartoons, so i measured 
                how good the show actually was i my opinion and how much I liked it as a child. I 
                didn't choose to go with my favorite anime because this blog would be much larger 
                than it is now. I have also played hundreds of games, so it was hard to pick one. 
                Unlike the cartoons, I wanted to pick one of the fairly recent games I played 
                because I debated putting the Wii Sports franchise or the Mario Kart franchise 
                as my favorite, but the realized that I liked those games a lot for the nostalgia 
                they give.
